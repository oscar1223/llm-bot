# LangChain AI Bots Collection

A collection of specialized bots developed using the **LangChain** framework and various AI models to perform different tasks related to natural language processing, document analysis, and specialized knowledge domains.

## ü§ñ Projects

### üìÑ ChatPDF
A document analysis bot that can:
- Process and analyze PDF documents
- Answer specific questions about the documents
- Generate complete or chapter-based summaries
- Provide page references for information sources

**Implementation**: Uses LangChain's document loading, text splitting, embeddings, and retrieval QA chains to create a conversational interface for PDF documents.

**Files**: 
- [main.py](chatpdf/main.py) - Terminal-based chat interface
- [pdfprocessing.py](chatpdf/pdfprocessing.py) - Core PDF processing functionality

### ü©∫ DoctorBot
A medical consultation bot that:
- Connects to reliable medical websites
- Answers health-related questions
- Provides advice on various diseases and ailments
- Uses a compassionate medical professional tone

**Implementation**: Uses a custom LangChain agent with DuckDuckGo search tools specifically targeted at medical websites to provide reliable health information.

**Files**:
- [Doctorbot.py](Doctorbot/Doctorbot.py) - Complete implementation with custom agent, tools, and memory

### üîÑ SQLConverter
A tool that:
- Converts SQL procedures and statements to Python scripts
- Performs database operations through conversational interfaces
- Translates database logic between languages

**Implementation**: Uses LangChain agents to analyze SQL code and generate equivalent Python implementations.

**Files**:
- [SQLconverter.py](SQLconverter/SQLconverter.py) - SQL to Python conversion functionality
- [llmsql.py](SQLconverter/llmsql.py) - Natural language to SQL database agent

### üñºÔ∏è LLM-OCR (Under Development)
A planned image-to-text processing bot that will:
- Extract text from images using OCR technology
- Process the extracted text using AI models
- Enable AI text analysis on image-based content

**Implementation**: Combines image processing techniques with LangChain's text analysis capabilities.

**Files**:
- [image_processor.py](llm-ocr/image_processor.py) - Image preprocessing and OCR functionality

### üìù LangChain Notes
A collection of examples and exercises demonstrating various LangChain features:
- Different types of chains (Sequential, Router)
- Agent implementations
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Memory implementations

**Files**:
- [chains.py](langchain%20notes/chains.py) - Examples of various LangChain chain implementations
